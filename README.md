# Forest Fire Weather Index Prediction

## Overview

The Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) Prediction project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the Fire Weather Index using meteorological and environmental data. The goal is to provide a tool that helps assess fire risk levels based on key weather parameters.

## Problem Statement

Forest fires are catastrophic events that can cause massive destruction. Predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) is crucial for early prevention and mitigation strategies. This project aims to develop an ML-based web application that accurately predicts FWI using supervised learning models.

## Goals

Develop an interactive web application for FWI prediction.

Implement a machine learning model for accurate predictions.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key influencing factors.

Optimize feature selection for improved model performance.

Deploy the model in a user-friendly Flask-based web interface.
